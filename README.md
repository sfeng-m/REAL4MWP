# environment  
python3.6, pytorch1.2\
You can install related packages directly through "```pip install requirements.txt```" or \
create virtual environment with required package by "```conda env create -f REAL.yaml```".

# preprocess data
    python3 memory_module.py

# train: 
     python3 run.py --is_train --train_batch_size 6 --num_train_epochs 80 \
        --start_lr_decay_epoch 40 --dataset math23k --topk 1 \
        --add_copynet --add_memory_module --is_equ_norm 

# test:
    python3 run.py --eval_batch_size 6  --dataset math23k --topk 1 \
        --add_copynet --add_memory_module --is_equ_norm 

# parallel
The project supports multi GPU parallel by setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.

# result
We don't spend more energy on adjusting the parameters of the model. You can get better results through parameter adjustment.
## top1 result:

## topk result:
Although REAL is trained with only a retrieved question, we still have the flexibility to adjust the number of retrieved questions 
at the testing stage by modifying the value of topk, which can affect the modelâ€™s performance.

In addition, It's simple to train topk retrieved questions by modifying the value of topk at training stage, which can obtain better result, though it is not show in our paper.
For example, We train top3 retrieved questions and test top3 retrieved questions, the result is:
